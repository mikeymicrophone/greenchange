 * Ripping out of plugems architecture to make this into a standard plugin

2007-11-01  Sean Soper <sean.soper@revolutionhealth.com>
 * Fixed bug where an empty migrations_info table would create a non-parseable schema.rb
 * Made plugin database independent
 * Added capability to step through migrations using VERSION=[previous, next, first and last]
 * dump_schema_information now returns all migrations, not just latest (credit to Fran√ßois Beausolei at http://blog.teksol.info/2007/11/1/enhanced-migrations-plugin-enhancement) 
 * Added tests which use SQLite and a task (enhanced_migrations:clean_sqlite_db) to the harness's rakefile to help with testing
