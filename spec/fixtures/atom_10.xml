        &lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of the "Product Service System," better known to some as PSS. Though the name is easy to trip over, the concept is brilliant: rather than buying everything you need outright, you can essentially "lease" or "rent" a product, deriving benefit from its service but not retaining ownership. That way, when you're done with it, you can pass it along to someone else, or, in some cases, back to the place where you got it, so they can distribute it to someone else to use for a little while. Confused? Don't be; there are examples everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2008-08-07-netflixproductservicesystem.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2008-08-07-netflixproductservicesystem.jpg" width="550" height="330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/graham-hill/carsharing-20-give-us-man_b_116989.html"&gt;mentioned car-sharing&lt;/a&gt; as a great PSS, but there are lots more we can all use (and, in some cases, already do). One that's familiar to a lot of us is Netflix. The service-as-product (which now has competition from &lt;a href="https://www.blockbuster.com/signup/howItWorks"&gt;Blockbuster's rent by mail&lt;/a&gt; program, among others) is well known to millions of Americas: sign up; make a list; receive movies in the mail; enjoy; return by mail; repeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://treehugger.com/"&gt;&lt;img&lt;br /&gt;
src='http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/25506/original.jpg'&lt;br /&gt;
align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not only does it make movie-watching more convenient and cut back on the clutter of having to own all these DVDs, it's greener than trucking off to the video store every time you want to catch a flick. A &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120127325/abstract"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Industrial Ecology&lt;/em&gt; concluded that even a two-mile drive to the video store will consume a few hundred times more energy than the Netflix delivery via mail from a distribution center 200 miles away. The authors run the numbers for a movie fan in Ann Arbor, Mich., concluding that renting online DVD rentals consumes about 33 percent less energy and emits 40 percent less CO2 than picking up those same movies at the traditional video store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Netflix isn't stopping there. Chief executive Reed Hastings, "We want to be integrated on every Internet-connected device, game system, high-definition DVD player and dedicated Internet set-top box. Eventually, as TVs have wireless connectivity built into them, we'll integrate right into the television." Pretty slick; while it's true that TiVo and other digital video recorders allow you to do this now, Netflix's proposed deal would leverage their huge catalog via the internet, allowing you to watch just about any movie your heart desires, any time. And you don't even have to go to the mailbox to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model easily extends to libraries, which essentially offer the same service with books (and many are now offering DVDs and CDs as well). There are also more specific services that use the web to offer a similar deal -- with the notable difference of being a paid service -- if your local library doesn't have the variety you desire; &lt;a href="http://americasbookshelf.com/"&gt;America's Bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; is one such place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to use stuff without owning it all -- and one that you may not have heard about -- is &lt;a href="http://neighborrow.com/index.html"&gt;Neighborrow&lt;/a&gt;. Founded on the premise that it's dumb to buy everything you need when you can just borrow it from your friends and neighbors when you need it, Neighborrow is part Freecycle, part Netflix and all product service system goodness. It allows you to pool your resources with your neighbors, and then borrow a food processor when you need one; when you're done, you just pass it back, and round and round we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded by Adam Berk in his New York City apartment, the site gives users the opportunity to both list what they're willing to share and what they're looking to use; you network with your neighbors to get 'em all done without having to resort to paying retail. Users are rated, so you know how reliable each one has been, and the site keeps track of where your stuff is, how long its been there, and when it's due back.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Some 250,000 Americans are HIV positive but unaware of it, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released Thursday, and most of them are not in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the past, people associated HIV with drug use and men who have sex with men," said Bernard Branson, associate director for Laboratory Diagnostics in CDC's division of HIV/AIDS prevention. "But the epidemic is changing, and there is an increased proportion of cases that have been reported in heterosexual transmissions and among women," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;American humorist Fran Lebowitz once said "Your life would not make a great book, don't even try" -- while I love Lebowitz's sentiment, one could strongly argue that some lives make great movies. As is the case of Philippe Petit, whose extraordinary life, at least a segment of it, is detailed in the new documentary &lt;i&gt;Man on Wire&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed by James Marsh, &lt;i&gt;Man on Wire&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Mr.Petit, a French street performer who in 1974 walked across a metal wire that was illegally mounted between the now fallen Twin Towers in lower Manhattan. While the act in of itself is a truly breathtaking sight (yes, there is footage), the narrative that leads us to these climatic moments is even more engaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story begins with Mr. Petit describing the first time he observed an artist's rendering of the not yet built World Trade Center -- the moment he lays eyes on such a sight, something in him clicks and he knows that it would be his destiny to cross the towers via a death-defying tightrope walk. He immediately sets out training himself on a wire and planning his first stunt. He brings along several friends and accomplices, including the flame of his youth. As his journey begins and the WTC is being built, we watch as he prepares himself by first walking between the towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral and later on conquering the Sydney Harbor Bridge in Australia. As the closing act approaches we move to New York, where he collects a team of willing participants who have been swayed by his charisma and a yearning to do something important, different and in a few cases -- illegal. The last portion of the film goes down like any great heist picture, with obstacle after obstacle being overcome through tenacity, a relentless desire to fulfill a vision, and pure luck. The picture culminates with our hero successfully playing the part of artist, acrobat and divine being as he seemingly strolls thousands of feet above downtown New York on a 450 pound wire strung between the now fallen symbols of American prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is finely crafted by Marsh and editor Jinx Godfrey, who intertwine stock footage, animation, interviews and reenactments -- giving the audience a picture that is fluid and building -- the film's plot always being presented by its narrator in the present rather than past tense, which keeps the viewer feeling as if they are watching an actual actual event unfold. The pacing ebbs and flows -- our director knows when to keep the narrative racing and when to break the tempo and let an emotional moment breath. Because of this, it never plods as many a documentary featuring this many talking heads. Another reason for its perceived expedience is that our helmer's greatest strength lay in is his ability to really pull performances from his subjects- enlightening us with their revelations and none is more enchanting than Mr. Petit, our high-wire walker, himself. By the end of the film, he could probably recruit any audience member to follow him to complete his next death defying showcase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major weakness of the film is present in some of the previously noted reenactment scenes. While many of these reflections of historical moments come off as so truthful that they fool many into believing that they are pieces of actual footage, there are just as many that tread the territory of cable mini-series. In that sense, the picture has an occasional uneven quality to it. Ninety percent of the work is fantastic and melds together as one cohesive whole; and the remainder either falls victim to, or almost falls victim to, the rare beat that took me out of the work by simply being tonally inept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stylistically speaking, this is a film that lends itself to those that certainly came before it -- and &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; is quite a loaded remark. There is absolutely nothing new here in the use of the medium -- the manner in which sequences are built and presented has clearly been influenced by the landmark work of pretty well known documentary filmmakers -- see Michael Moore. Now where our filmmakers stage a great departure here, aesthetically speaking, is in these aforementioned reenactment pieces. Like I had earlier suggested -- the ones that work, really work. They have a certain pseudo-realistic quality, playing with the picture's look, framing, and camera movement to simulate home recorded films -- but with a more deliberate touch from a directorial stand point.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a film that is about fearlessness. In the most literal sense -- yes walking on a wire between the Twin Towers takes a dash of fearlessness. What I'm referring to can be summed up by Petit himself. He reflects in the film that as he stood looking over the edge of the WTC, he realized that this could be his end. He says that his comfort came in the idea that even if he were to die, it would be in the act of his art, of his passion, of love and of life. This is the core of the film. No matter what the stakes, what the pain, what the discord -- we should never stop ourselves from following through with our goals because of fear of failure or loss -- instead we should only seek to cloak ourselves in the joy of the attempt and the beauty in having the sense to try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, I also see this work as a portrait of a man who is centered on his fear. Every action, every emotion, every relationship is spent digging further and further away from failure. So in a sense, the picture could be seen as a film about the process by which a person can channel their fear, use their fear -- even relentlessly, in a way that could only spark the greatest of success. At the same time, such vigor also promotes a certain destructiveness apparent in Mr. Petit's self-justifying moral ambiguity, particularly on the topic of the intimate relationships that he builds and abruptly abandons at the close of the picture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a life changing film, it is certainly a life a affirming work. I highly suggest it for anyone who has ever tried to "live the dream" as it were, or for those that may need a swift kick of inspiration to get them back on that horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something to be said of the idea that some lives are stories that are meant to be told -- &lt;i&gt;Man on Wire&lt;/i&gt; is certainly one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Man on Wire&lt;/i&gt; is currently playing in NYC and will begin rolling out nationally on Aug 8.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

    <title>Unconventional Weaponry: Man Tries To Rob Video Store With A Jello Box</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A West Virginia man recently attempted to rob a video store wielding an empty Jello box, claiming the container held a bomb. The &lt;a href="http://wvgazette.com/latest/200808070712"&gt;Charleston Gazette&lt;/a&gt; reports on the crack police work that occurred: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It was some kind of cheesecake dessert ... I'm not sure if it was pre-made," said Sgt. Aaron James, assistant chief of detectives for Charleston police. "I think he had just bought it at Kroger, and he ate it. Then he got the notion to go in and rob the business." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, no one was hurt. However, this raises a question: does it count as a weapon if his intent was to inflict &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9704/24/nfm/index.html"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jello-gentleman later came to his senses about his choice of weapon:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Before Parrish admitted to committing the crime, he watched the tape of the robbery with detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'That looks like a Jello box.' We said, 'Yeah, we think so too,'" James said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current state of the video rental business, he may have also later realized that he should have planned some sort of identity fraud on Netflix customers instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;La Paz, Bolivia -- On Sunday, Aug. 10, Bolivians will go to the polls to vote on whether or not to recall the president, vice president and the governors of eight of the nation's nine departments. Just two-and-a-half years into the term of President Evo Morales, his government is racked by political crises. This week alone, two miners participating in a protest for higher pensions were killed in clashes with police; a meeting in the Bolivian town of Tarija between the presidents of Venezuela, Argentina and Bolivia was canceled when protesters tried to storm the airport; and President Morales will not attend the traditional independence celebration in Sucre on Wednesday, August 6 for fear of anti-government violence.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
While the president and vice-president are expected to survive the recall, perhaps even overturning a few opposition governors (seven out of nine governors are in the opposition), the tensions tearing at this divided nation's social fabric will persist.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
On one side of this struggle is the impoverished indigenous majority in the western highlands who, along with Bolivia's first indigenous president Evo Morales, are trying to redistribute power and wealth towards poor communities. Pitted against them is a mostly white elite based in the eastern part of the country who want to keep tight control over the nation's wealth and are using their money and control of the media to foment widespread discontent. Sadly, the U.S. government, instead of embracing social transformation in Latin America's poorest nation, is aiding and abetting the opposition.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
At the opening meeting of a group called International Intellectuals and Artists for the Unity and Sovereignty of Bolivia on July 26, Bolivian President Evo Morales put the division in simple terms. "Two models of government are on the table," he said. "One is a colonial model where a few families control the nation's resources. The other, which we defend, is based on the nationalization of natural resources for the benefit of everyone."&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Morales' government nationalized the nation's most important source of revenue, natural gas and has used the profits for social programs that fight poverty and inequality. These include free school meals and a cash payment to mothers who keep their children in school. Morales has also raised the minimum wage and expanded the number of eligible elderly people receiving pensions from 489,000 to 676,000, providing them with the equivalent of 27 dollars a month. [Nearly 60 percent of elderly people in Bolivia live on less than one dollar a day.] He is also trying to institute a land reform that would take non-productive agricultural land from wealthy landowners and give it to poor, landless families.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Morales has appealed to progressive governments in the region to help with his program of social transformation. Cuba has sent thousands of doctors and teachers to rural areas and is building dozens of hospitals. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Brazilian President Lula da Silva are investing in the expansion of Bolivia's gas industry and helping to construct new highways.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Turn on the radio or the television these days, however, and you'll hear a different story. A barrage of opposition ads encourage people to vote against the President in the upcoming recall. They scare people into thinking that Morales is going to take away their private property, like their homes or their cars, and paint him as a "Chavez-style dictator" who has indebted the country to Venezuela.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
"I apologize to the journalists here," Morales said at the scholars' meeting, "but in Bolivia the press is engaged in media terrorism. I know it's not you, the journalists, but the owners of the means of communication. They manipulate the news and the polls; they lie to the public."&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
He gave a recent example. He had just come from visiting Camiri, a town in the department of Santa Cruz, which is the home of the opposition. A large group of people came out to welcome him and listen to his speech. At the end of the rally he heard some firecrackers and was told that there were a handful of protesters. On his way back to the airport, however, he heard a local radio station say that the people of Camiri had blocked him from coming to the city. "I had to laugh," said Morales, "because there were perhaps 20 young protesters compared to crowds of supporters. But that's how they reported 'the news.'"&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The recall vote comes on the heels of a series of referendums organized by these powerful elites in the eastern departments calling for autonomy from the national government. They have been able to mobilize significant sectors of the population, including people who once supported Morales but have been disillusioned by what they perceive as government corruption and incompetence.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
While the autonomy referendums passed, they were claimed illegal not only by the President, but by the Bolivian Electoral Court, the Organization of American States, the European Union or other major leaders throughout the region.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The next vote is the Aug. 10 recall vote. If Morales and Vice President Alvaro Garcia lose, they have to hold new elections within 90 to 120 days. If any of the governors lose, Morales gets to select interim governors until the next election.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Polls indicate that the president and vice president will win, thanks in part the government's massive voter registration drive and the fact that many voters who are critical of Morales will back him so as not to strengthen the right-wing opposition.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
A win at the polls is crucial, but it is not likely to stop the growing tensions that have polarized the country, created a crisis between national and local legal institutions, dried up private investment and led to increasingly violent clashes between supporters on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The following are some of the crises the government will still have to contend with:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
* If several opposition governors lose, they and their supporters may refuse to accept the results, which could lead to increased violence and make certain departments ungovernable;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
*  A new constitution that aims to include Bolivia's historically excluded indigenous majority within a "plurinational" state, with greater state control over natural resources, was passed in December 2007 by an assembly that was boycotted by opposition parties. It still awaits approval in a national referendum that is being blocked by the opposition-controlled Senate.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
* Even the location of the nation's capital is in dispute. Sucre, which is in the hands of the opposition, is the historic capital of Bolivia, but all the state powers were shifted to La Paz in the wake of the 1899 Federal War between conservatives in the south and liberals around La Paz. Opposition leaders, however, have been complaining about "La Paz centralism" and whipping up local sentiment for Sucre to become the capital. This has led to violent clashes that will likely continue.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
* Tensions with the U.S. government have been rising, as more information comes out regarding U.S. support for the opposition. The Morales administration has accused the US Agency for International Development (AID) of working to undermine it. Vice President Alvaro Garcia said the U.S. was trying to develop "ideological and political resistance." In June the Bush administration recalled its ambassador to Bolivia for several weeks following massive protests outside the US embassy, which the U.S. accused Morales of inciting. As Bolivia continues to strengthen its ties with leftist governments in the region and reject free market economic policies, it will face increasing opposition from the U.S. government.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Back at the gathering of Intellectuals and Artists, Frei Betto, a well-loved liberation theologist from Brazil, spoke on behalf of the group when he told Morales, "We've come from all over the continent to show our support because the future of Bolivia affects the future of all of Latin America. We're inspired by your efforts at social transformation and we hope that the August 10 vote takes place in an atmosphere of peace, tolerance and respect for the sovereign will of the Bolivian people."&lt;br /&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological impairment... all medical jargon, are perilous threats to our military personnel.  Hundreds of thousands of servicemen and women will return from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with some form of complex psychological health issue.  For this reason, the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund (IFHF) has undertaken the project of raising $70 million to fund the construction of a state-of-the-art facility to treat soldiers with these disorders.  Once completed, the IFHF will turn over the facility to the government to operate.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second project of this kind the IFHF has taken on.  In January 2007, the IFHF opened a center to treat physical injuries called the Center for the Intrepid at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.  It is now the finest military physical rehabilitation center for military amputees in the world, all privately paid for by over 600,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new center, to be called the National Intrepid Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (NICoE), will be located at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban Washington D.C.  The hope is to have enough funds committed to the project for it to be completed next year.  It will be a 75,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art treatment and rehabilitation center and a place where scientists from around the world will gather to share their research.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is a much tougher project to accomplish because mental and brain injuries are not visible to the untrained eye.  Soldiers can be living with problems that no one can see.  And, problems such as post traumatic stress disorder can surface years later if left untreated.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only recently that we finally understand that many of the homeless living under our nation's bridges suffered from that abnormality.    It is only recently that the Rand report identified the fact that up to 300,000 troops have been exposed to some form of TBI and PTSD and that number may actually be much, much higher.  And it is only recently that our country has been galvanized to address this national peril.  We are no longer embarrassed to talk about mental health for our brave warriors.  They deserve the best care and this Center will be the core of that effort.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centers will not only provide treatment but will also be research facilities.  Improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment will be fed back out to the military and VA hospitals and the medical facilities in the field.  Long-term follow-up care will also be incorporated into the system plan to ensure that, once soldiers separate from the military, they do not separate from whatever continued treatment they need.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Intrepid Center of Excellence will send a message to military personnel overseas fighting for the freedom of others. We will always remember the sacrifices made by our brave, young heroes and their families, and we will continue to support our soldiers by providing them with world-class support when they return. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;McCain's campaign hides secret of Iraq surge "success." &lt;a href="http://therealnews.com"&gt;Real News Network&lt;/a&gt; analyst, Pepe Escobar looks at the flipping and the flopping of McCain's "surge" message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="450" height="272" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/ shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://therealnews.com/permalinkedembed/mediaplayer.swf" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /&gt;&lt;param name="menu" value="false" /&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="false" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="&amp;displayheight=253&amp;file=http://therealnews.com/permalinkedvideorss/videoembedrss.php?oneid=yes%26bw=300%26myrn=%26searchfor=2006%26campaigncode=&amp;height=272&amp;width=450&amp;frontcolor=0x015E50&amp;backcolor=0xffffff&amp;lightcolor=0x666666&amp;screencolor=0xffffff&amp;autoscroll=true&amp;bufferlength=5&amp;shuffle=false" /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://therealnews.com/permalinkedembed/mediaplayer.swf" width="450" height="272" allowfullscreen="false" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="&amp;displayheight=253&amp;file=http://therealnews.com/permalinkedvideorss/videoembedrss.php?oneid=yes%26bw=300%26myrn=%26searchfor=2006%26campaigncode=&amp;height=272&amp;width=450&amp;frontcolor=0x015E50&amp;backcolor=0xffffff&amp;lightcolor=0x666666&amp;screencolor=0xffffff&amp;autoscroll=true&amp;bufferlength=5&amp;shuffle=false"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presidential hopeful, John McCain is adamant about his wartime experience. He has steadfastly stuck by President Bush in his selling of the surge in Iraq, and then changed his mind -- hedged his bets, recovered, retracted, insisted.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines McCain's position in relation to the Iraq war and his interpretation of the surge's "success." Escobar compares McCain's interpretation to the many overlapping political and military facts on the ground in Iraq before and during the surge.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With few exceptions, it's now possible to say that most everybody everywhere is an environmentalist, especially politicians running for higher office. Even the major oil companies and oil rich Gulf state are sponsoring environmental initiatives and research into alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all want to wean the world, and ourselves, off of fossil fuels to the extent possible. If you've had at least $23,000 to buy a new car in the last year, chances are you've seriously considered a hybrid (and chances are also good that if you have two or more young kids, you decided that the only hybrids that get really good mileage -- the Prius and Civic hybrids -- are just too small to function as family cars. Why haven't Toyota and Honda put out hybrid Siennas and Odysseys?!). Perhaps you've even bought a solar system if you have $15,000 to spare and are spending enough on gas and electricity to recoup the investment within 15 years (note to southern California readers: this is the excuse you've been waiting for to buy that hot tub you don't really need).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for everyone of us who daydreams -- as do I -- about pulling our plug-in Prius into the garage, filling it up with relatively clean Compressed Natural Gas using our home nozzle (if the Pakistani government subsidizes the conversion of cars to CNG, why can't the US?), and recharging the hybrid batteries using the energy produced for free from our home solar panels, there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Americans who have barely enough money to pay for heat in their drafty apartments or homes during the winter, or for gas for their beat-up, 2nd or 3rd hand -- and most likely environmentally incorrect -- 12-year-old Fords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the majority of working class Americans, barring an unprecedented and highly unlikely (no matter who wins in November) government investment into creating an inexpensive post-petroleum consumer infrastructure, the majority of their fuel, whether for their homes or cars, is going to come from petroleum and their main concern is going to be how to afford the oil and gas they need to live rather than how to spend enough money to purchase more fuel efficient cars, solar systems, and other costly contraptions that while crucial to saving the environment are still far out of reach for too many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter "Music is Our Oil," a recently created collaborative venture, whose two principals, Mikal Kamil and Dan Levin, are music industry pros who have set before themselves the task of galvanizing the entertainment industry and the energy industry into what they are calling the "Great Collaboration". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mikal explained it to me, the Great Collaboration "will manifest itself in the form of a worldwide concert tour/film titled "Music is our Oil" (MIO) whose goal will be to barter American entertainment, goods, and commodities for oil. Specifically, we intend to barter the performances of well-known hip-hop and rock artists for 20 million barrels of crude oil produced by OPEC member nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venture didn't start out as such a complex and far-thinking program. Instead, it started in Philadelphia, where Kamil and Levin are based when the two brought in rap heavyweights like Public Enemy and The Roots to help raise money to pay for heating oil for the city's poorer residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We stumbled into this thing, thought of great way to bring immediate relief to people in community by doing a benefit that combined the entertainment and energy industries, two of the most important and far-reaching business sectors in the world today, whose activities touch the lives of nearly everyone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were mentored by other festivals like Farm Aid and Citizens' Energy, who introduced us to the idea of bartering, and then, of all companies, Venezuela's national oil company, Citgo, came in and helped tremendously getting oil to poor inhabitants of Philly and other cities. It wasn't until we began producing events for Barack Obama's campaign in Philadelphia that we learned from his skilled team what our responsibilities as Americans were. We are forever grateful to his campaign for awakening our potential and changing our lives." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say that my knee-jerk reaction merely to the suggestion of working with ExxonMobil and other major oil companies was extremely negative. But the tens of millions of poor people in this country can't afford to take principled stands when they can obtain the fuel they need at prices that could spell the difference between making it through the next month or seeing their homes foreclosed or cars repossessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kamil explains, "The idea is to prove naysayers wrong about grass roots activism," by showing how even two industries as seemingly at odds as the environmentally uber-aware music business and the ultra-polluting petroleum industry can work together to address the urgent needs of millions of citizens, then we an also work together to solve the pressing long term problems associated with global warming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me as someone who works on issues related to oil and the economy is that the project is neither selling out to the major American oil companies nor merely lending them desperately needed credibility, but going more directly to the source in the countries who produce most of the foreign oil purchases by the US, while at the same time creating linkages to pre-existing infrastructures, industries and technologies to have immediate impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the music side, Kamil has already lined up cooperation from The Roots, Public Enemy, Erykah Badu, Stanley Clarke, Stanley Jordan, Everlast and other acts, and is reaching out to others with the hopes of lining up a tour that can  generate millions of barrels of oil -- 20 million barrels, in fact. The oil will be the "barter" with which the OPEC and non-OPEC governments in whose countries the artists play will pay for their services (the artists would donate most of their normal fee,. allowing the oil to be given directly to the needy through the use of a new currency called the Mio, which will be based in gallons of gasoline rather than US dollars and giving out gas cards which can be redeemed at most service stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, the tour will begin in June 09 in Canada and move on to Norway, Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and finally Latin America, before ending six weeks later in the USA. There will also be a film documenting the whole tour, tentatively titled "What The Hell Is Going On."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is certainly an apt description for what in fact is going on when it comes to oil and the various mechanisms surrounding the huge rise in oil prices in the last few years. At the very least, bringing artists on a grass roots endeavor to engage the peoples of countries that are often in tension with the United States (as are many OPEC nations) can increase international goodwill and ease geopolitical tensions at a time when both are needed. And bartering with governments in the Middle East seems to be an eminently more practical approach to dealing with our need for foreign oil than bombing or occupying them. So even if you already drive a Prius or own a solar system, if you see the MIO tour coming your way, do yourself a favor and check it out. The music will be great, message important, and you'll be helping some of your less fortunate neighbors pay for the gas and heat that is becoming an increasing burden for millions of low income and elderly Americans each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hillary's silence is deafening. And it's, in some measure, the reason why Obama's lead has disappeared against McCain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was predictable given her acrimony during the primary season. All that's happened, since her ungracious concession, has been an announcement that Bill Richardson is going to try and help them raise funds to pay down their huge primary campaign debts and that she will campaign for Obama in Florida and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the Clintons are aiming for 2012. They began doing so when they turned nasty against Obama during the primary marathon. They are betting, and by so doing they are helping, McCain win a one-term presidency. By that time, Hillary will have been re-elected to the Senate and Bill's business activities and some questionable associations will be ancient history. But that's just Bill's "fairy tale" ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I wrote in the Huffington Post about this on June 1 followed by a few quotes from HP readers who now look prescient:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By Wednesday morning, Hillary and Obama will up neck and neck in popular vote, give or take 100,000 votes between them.

&lt;p&gt;That means the pressure will be on for him to make her his running-mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she may not be interested. In fact, she will likely turn down recruiting efforts. If you take the Clintons at their word Obama is doomed to failure so why would she want to go down in flames with him this fall against McCain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not like she hasn't made this perfectly clear. Her feelings about Obama's inadequacies have been articulated and broadcasted for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has said he is an untried rookie who shouldn't get the nod and can't beat McCain. Her character assassination has been subtle but effective: The reference to Bobby Kennedy. Her doubts about his beliefs, (he's Christian or so they tell me). Her attacks on his manhood. Her husband's description of Obama's entire campaign as a "fairy tale."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these statements and others will be generously splashed across Republican ads this fall to the point that some voters, who only wake up to their democracy during elections, may actually think she is McCain's running-mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining the Obama teams means she will have shot herself in the foot beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what emerges is what I believe is the Clinton no-lose strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have used Obama's unelectability as their excuse to continue running against him even though they cannot win because, by saying he's unelectable, they help in part to bring about his defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His defeat by McCain would make them look really smart and also set them up for the nomination and run in 2012. This is based on their professed logic that only Hillary can win against McCain; McCain will be a one-termer because he will be decrepit in four years and there will be a job vacancy in 2012 for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky part for Hillary will be to appear to be a team player if she declines the VP slot or isn't even asked. Obama will offer both of them something in return for a few stump speeches made in between long absences from the campaign due to "exhaustion."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few choice comments from HP posters following this entry which point to why Obama is lagging and not getting Hillary's voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bakossi wrote: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The tricky part for Hillary is that if Obama loses this fall, a lot of his supporters (myself included) will be as angry with her as her supporters are with Obama. We will look at the exit polls, look at how many white older women, for example, went over to the other side because of her repeated gender card plays, and begin organizing immediately (b/c a lot of the grass roots organizers are Obama supporters) not only to deny her any chance at the 2012 nomination, but to unseat her from the Senate as well. Unlike Lieberman in Connecticut, if she loses the Democratic primary in NY, she's toast, and we may support an independent against her as well, just to make sure. If her supporters decide a term of McCain is just 'punishment' for alleged Obama 'sins,' our attitude is going to be: "why not two?" So to Hillary supporters in advance, if this is the plan, we're letting you know: WE told YOU so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone has to pay Clinton to play.&lt;br /&gt;
"Negotiations are understood to be taking place between the Obama and Clinton campaigns about the Illinois senator helping to repay some of the massive debt incurred by his rival. One of Hillary Clinton"s donors said that the former First Lady"s campaign was as much as $40 million in the red.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawlishgal:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;She has already damaged Obama to the point that she can't do much more harm, and she has inflamed her crazy people so that they won't vote for him even if she tells them to. But, hey Obama might win anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;
And she can't be expected to campaign for him because Hillary does not campaign for presidential candidates....remember 2000 and 2004 where she and Bill sat on their hands and waited for Bush victories so they could keep the seat warm for her;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourex:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that Bill and Hillary will actively undermine the Obama campaign in the general election. The animosity they displayed to those who supported Bill's eight years in the WH is mind numbing. Then they disgustingly courted the Bush bigots to continue the race. They have the hubris to slander most of the party and then run as Democrats in 2012.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paralogos:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the moment Hilary Clinton endorsed John McCain over Barack Obama in the famous "commander-in-chief test" soundbite, she made it clear that she is NOT a team player. She staked everything on grabbing the nomination this time. If she fails - and it sure looks as if she is failing - her aspirations to be the Democratic candidate for president, or indeed to hold any national position for the Democratic party, are dead. That's one of the reason's she's carrying on so desperately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisakaz:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;She probably is angling for 2012 but make no mistake: Obama supporters DO NOT WANT HER AS VP. Sorry. To present this like that door is open is its own "fairy tale" I think.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as many &lt;a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/francis/default.aspx"&gt;commentators have pointed &lt;/a&gt;out recently, Carter led Reagan in the polls until the 1980 debate when Ronnie landed a KO punch just as Obama likely will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

    <title>Huffpollstrology: Candidates' Horoscopes, Polls And More For August 7</title>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polls have come to dominate the media's horse race coverage of political campaigns. Pundits and reporters constantly use them to tell us who's hot and who's not -- but skip over the fact that plummeting response rates and variables like undecided voters and margins of error often render these polls useless as anything other than lightweight diversions on par with horoscopes and political betting lines. Below you'll find a slew of polling, astrological, and betting information that will hopefully help the polling junkies in the media keep polls in the proper perspective.

&lt;p&gt;We've also updated HuffPollstrology to bring you regular takes from astrologers on the state of the presidential race. And we've included a section that digs deeper into how polls are conducted.  And to make sure we're really investigating, we're going to add various blogs and articles that cast a skeptical eye on polling.  Read on for lots of HuffPollstrology:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style="border-bottom: 1px;"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASTROLOGER PHILIP SEDGWICK LOOKS AT THE CANDIDATES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The campaigns say one thing about the candidates.  But does astrology say something else?  Read my esteemed colleague Philip Sedgwick's take on McCain and Obama's birthchart. Find out who's really winning despite what the polls suggest - Astrologer Phyllis Mitz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take heed politicians. Do as your predecessors did while leading our ancestral humankind to a better tomorrow. Follow the pole star. That's pole star, not pollster. And keep in mind that over the centuries the pole star changes as does the political landscape between now and November.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This column will follow the horoscopes of the presumptive nominees, John McCain and Barack Obama (listed and interpreted alphabetically), as we eagerly approach November's election. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How odd that both presidential candidates chose to incarnate in the month of August, though of different sign lineage? How odd is it that both candidates have planets at corresponding degrees in the sign of Virgo and right now both candidates reap the benefits/hazards of a megadose of Virgo planets above?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John McCain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2008-08-07-McCainhoroscope.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2008-08-07-McCainhoroscope.jpg" width="500" height="411" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually starting a day or so ago and taking the chart through the upcoming weekend news cycle, the feisty, edgy, uppity and impulsive Mars aligns with McCain's planet that deals with economics and matters relating to women. Whatever you do, do not do anything or suggest anything that could be construed as offensive to women. Dang, there was that Sturgis Buffalo Chip Cindy thing, but maybe if you avoid the issue of a woman's right to choose over the next several days, that'll fall away neatly. Fall away if you leave international destinations... like the Paris Hilton... alone. Why not shift the course entirely? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within days the money planet Venus meets up with your Sun sign. Focus, get serious and get into a valid, viable economic posture if you intend to have a snowball's chance of having people imagine that they might be better off during your administration. Since Virgo is involved, refrain from the nearly irresistible temptation to slam your opponent's ideas or select a nugget of a plan and dis it, especially if that tidbit actually makes a real difference... and sense. The energy of the time demands solutions and a platform that declares such solutions. Criticism and being too silly falls short of the mark. Maybe it's too simple. There is that reputation Virgos have for losing sight of the forest because of the trees. This would be a great time to announce thoughtful and thorough economic reform that can be implemented coinciding with a most favorable pattern falling on September 12th. This pattern, which astrologers call a Jupiter-Saturn trine, renders a nifty balance between income and expenditures, expansion and contraction, and a conservative spirit of adventure that allows the farthest growth possible. During this window, a Senator could launch a program of comprehensive economic reform and have it be well received. Dang again, that's right... nobody's home. I forgot. Just yesterday you chastised Congress for its dog days of summer vacation and leaving the country unattended... as you stumped in the Dakotas well away from the rotunda for how long now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another one for you. As the Olympics begin and the President makes his mark in China, it would be a great time to establish a clear demarcation line from any policy that could be construed as theologically or culturally exclusive. Fortunately or not, astronomers recently established a new cultural and social archetype with the naming of a new dwarf planet, Makemake, creating an archetype that insists upon bridging across cultural and spiritual differences. Not only is inclusion an insightful policy, it's a lot simpler than the alternative of persistently holding those "different from" at safe distance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barack Obama &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="2008-08-07-Obamahoroscope.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2008-08-07-Obamahoroscope.jpg" width="500" height="411" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hope you're reading this early on the day of posting. You are on the verge of having what astrologers call a Mars return. This effect sets up a two-year cycle of activity in which you decide what kind of action figure you'd like to be. The first time a person has one of these is age two - the terrible two's or when a little one getting into all kinds of stuff learns the primary four letter words "no-no" and "stop." It's like that for adults every two years, too. For the next five to seven days you're dancing on the sword of truth. You must cut down all deceptive proclamations and set the records straight. However, it's easy to irritate people under this pattern especially if your commentaries sound critical or condescending. Despite the temptation, resist the urge to call silly and stupid ideas silly and stupid. Secure the strap on your holster so there's no shooting from the hip. Offer superior solutions without claiming the superiority of those plans, staying modest and simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just had an eclipse on your Sun as you enjoyed your recent birthday. This gives your charisma and visibility huge injections; the injections can result in the appearance of over the top or a bit much. You'll want to tone that down over the next several days. Between now and the next eclipse (August 16th), why not let the issues unfold around you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like your presumed opponent you will be having a transit from Venus over the next several days. Unlike your presumed opponent your Venus transit contacts Pluto. Pluto, lord of the underworld, symbolizes greed and potent energy and is the residence of the formation of oil. How convenient that these factors merge at this crossroad in such a poignant campaign collision. If you establish clearly defined protocols that voters know cannot be stalled or opposed in Congress, which address the Enron loophole, oil company windfall profits and alternate energy strategies, including a well-defined position on nuclear possibilities, you can adjust your rear view mirror to determine your opponent's position. There is a reason for the term Plutocracy. There's a reason for the term Plutocrite as well. Get down with Pluto and be neither.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally in the spirit of the planetary patterns, point out to your opponent that an individual who changes her/his mind when presented with better information is open-minded, progressive and evolving. That is not a flip flopper. Why not redefine flip flopper as one who has mind changes in direct relationship to the receipt of recent campaign contributions? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun out there. See you next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philip Sedgwick, an astrologer with more than three decades of experience began his study while serving in the U. S. Navy in a combat capacity aboard a frigate off the coast of Vietnam. Like Barack Obama he is a citizen of planet Earth and resident of the galaxy. His work includes research, writing and personal consultations. His website: &lt;a href="http://www.philipsedgwick.com"&gt;www.philipsedgwick.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style="border-bottom: 1px;"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
POLLING METHODOLOGY:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost is delving into the gray area of how polls are conducted. Below is an analysis of how pollsters come up with the numbers through response rates. The definition of a response rate is taken from &lt;a href="http://ariannaonline.huffingtonpost.com/columns/column.php?id=484"&gt;Arianna's 1998 column "Investigating The Pollsters."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The key to polling's accuracy is the principle of "equal probability of selection." But if larger and larger numbers among those randomly selected refuse to participate, this principle no longer applies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked polling companies to please give us the response and refusal rates for their polls listed below.  Each polls was released on August 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP/Ipsos Poll Conducted July 31-August 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Obama 47, McCain 41
Method: Random sample of 1,002 adults across the country over five days. 833 were registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;
"Can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll?":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ipsos representative: "As far as I know we don't publish response and refusal rates...We conducted the poll for the Associated Press, you'd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Associated Press representative: "We don't have them here from Ipsos. It takes a little while for them to get those to us...I can ask them. It shouldn't take too long, but normally it takes a few days...They're not secret or anything."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gallup Daily Poll Conducted August 2-August 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Obama 47, McCain 43
Method:2,674 registered voters polled over three days.
"Can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll?": 14 percent response rate, 26 percent refusal rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rasmussen Daily Tracking Poll Conducted August 3-August 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Obama 45, McCain 43
Method: Sample of 3,000 likely voters over three days.
"Can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll?": Representative has not yet returned email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBS News Poll Conducted 
July 31-August 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Obama 45, McCain 39 
Method: Polled 1,034 --of that, 906 were registered voters.
"Can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll?": Representative has not yet returned email.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="hpoll_astro_text"&gt;If you're given to over-the-top reaction on occasion, then you might 'spontaneously combust' when an intriguing offer is made. Even if that's not your style, you're likely to be moved by events. From finding a bargain whilst on holiday to news that a close friend is being offered an escape route from a job they now dislike, you could be forced to think out of your usual comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Caution:  Irony alert.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I know it's a surprising conclusion, but hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as April of 2001, the man some call "The Architect" wrote in a memo to Paul Wolfowitz that the anthrax vaccine was "&lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Memo_shows_White_House_knew_of_0807.html"&gt;a political problem for us&lt;/a&gt;."  That's right.  Rove was worried about the very same thing &lt;em&gt;Bruce Ivins&lt;/em&gt; was allegedly worried about:  the anthrax vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider the targets of those anthrax attacks:  As Senate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle was the Democrat most strategically placed to block Rove's political agenda.  Then there's Patrick Leahy.  As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Leahy was in an excellent position to investigate whatever shenanigans Rove was already planning over at the Justice Department.  (That attack was a rare tactical error on Rove's part, however.  As a longtime Grateful Dead fan, Leahy is unusually drug-resistant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Brokaw at NBC was yet another target.  Rove was &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=76We8KhOkJIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=rove+brokaw&amp;source=web&amp;ots=T9nEhwnNtd&amp;sig=zDf49ZoBC8Kylf7cb0rBSgr7uYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA92,M1"&gt;publicly embarrassed on NBC &lt;/a&gt;during the 2000 election when he claimed Florida for Bush and was contradicted on-air by Tim Russert.  And who was NBC's anchor that night?  Chill alert: &lt;em&gt;Tom Brokaw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(People, including &lt;a href="http://nightlight.typepad.com/nightlight/2007/04/bush_rove_joke_.html"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;,  gave NBC's David Gregory a hard time for "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYZre8kEsuw"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt;" with Rove last year.  But if we knew then what Gregory knew - about what the man is capable of doing when angered - well, heck, son.  &lt;em&gt;You'd &lt;/em&gt;dance too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The there's the Big One, of course:  These attacks contributed to an atmosphere of terror that allowed Rove to win (at least temporarily) the political dominance he'd always craved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that pretty much covers motive.  Then there's the matter of character.  Our suspect, a man in his fifties, has a history of grievous misbehavior that dates back to his college days.  He &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/rove072399.htm"&gt;acknowledges entering a Democratic politician's office at the tender age of 19 and stealing materials in order to carry out an elaborate deception&lt;/a&gt;.  And accounts of his high school student years characterize him as "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/09/uselections2004.usa1"&gt;a nerd and a motor mouth&lt;/a&gt;,"  which covers the "weirdness" angle that all these accusations of high-profile murder require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that he likes to go quail-hunting?  With a rifle?  A &lt;em&gt;deadly weapon?&lt;/em&gt;  And now our potential "perp" is under investigation by the Congress of the United States for a number of alleged crimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's see:  We've covered "motive" and "character."  That leaves "opportunity," which is an easy one.  As a close confidant of the President, Rove had access to pretty much every government resource (civilian &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; military) that he wanted.  That would include grades of anthrax that, unlike those &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/06/fbi_documents/index.html"&gt;discussed by the FBI yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, were powdered and weaponized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; believe Karl Rove is the anthrax killer?  Of course not.  This is &lt;i&gt;satire,&lt;/i&gt; not some wacky conspiracy theory.  And after all, who in their right mind would accuse someone of something so serious with such sketchy and circumstantial evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh.  &lt;a href="http://anthraxvaccine.blogspot.com/2008/08/beyond-reasonable-doubt.html"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Everyone remembers the 2000 presidential election with its excruciating post-election vote counting controversy in Florida and the Supreme Court decision that awarded the presidency to George W. Bush.  But how many people remember the Gallup 2000 election tracking poll?  I'm sure the Gallup folks would like us to forget it, but in light of the controversy over Gallup's recent poll for &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; that showed a big discrepancy between registered and likely voters, it's worth recalling just how well Gallup's likely voter screen performed in the weeks leading up to the 2000 election. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Robert Erikson of Columbia University has &lt;a href="http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/4/588"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, Gallup's likely voter screen had the effect of producing tremendous volatility in the results of their daily tracking poll.  The volatility was due less to variation in the preferences of registered voters than to differences in which voters were identified as likely to vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how volatile where Gallup's results?  Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 8 Gallup had Bush 2 points ahead of Gore.  Six days later, on August 13 they had Bush 16 points ahead.  But one week later, on August 20, they had Gore back ahead by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craziness didn't end with the nominating conventions either.  On September 21 Gallup had Bush ahead of Gore by 10 points.  Four days later, on September 25, Gore was back in the lead by 3.  Then on October 5 Gallup had Bush ahead by 11.  The next day, on October 6, his lead was down to one, and one day later, on October 7, Gore was ahead by 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my favorite.  On October 24 Gallup had Gore ahead of Bush by one point.  Three days later, on October 27, they had Bush ahead by 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their final pre-election poll Gallup gave Bush a 2 point lead--not too bad since Gore won the popular vote by less than a point.  But two days earlier, Gallup had Bush ahead by 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other poll during the 2000 campaign showed anything like the volatility of the Gallup tracking poll and so far Gallup's 2008 tracking poll has shown nothing like the volatility of their 2000 tracking poll.  That's probably because they haven't started to apply their likely voter screen to the tracking poll.  So here's some friendly advice to the folks at Gallup: Don't, at least not until the last few days before the election when it might actually work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Today, I've been taken back a few thousand years in China's history by the world's leading scholar on China and the Olympics, Professor &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-brownell"&gt;Susan Brownell&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Missouri and Beijing Sports University. Her keynote address at the close of the Olympic conference I've been attending interrogated Western centrism within the Olympic Movement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know Susan quite well and we've met a few times in the last year. I even have a few photographs in her new book, &lt;em&gt;Beijing's Games: What the Olympics Mean to China&lt;/em&gt;. She speaks great Mandarin and has had unrivalled access to the Olympic community in China, including being the biographer of Zheliang He, the IOC Chair of the Culture and Education Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan has also spent a lot of her passed months interviewing for the world's press about the Games and this week she's hardly out of a studio or off the phone. When I spoke to her some months ago in Ancient Olympia just after the fires in Greece, she expressed some reticence about this prospect. However, she's placed herself wholeheartedly into the subject of her analysis -- the Western media's representation of China. Her ideas speak to critical issues that have framed Beijing's Games - disputes about media freedoms and bias. As a true anthropologist, she stressed the importance of the West learning Chinese and Asian languages generally, if it ever hopes to shed its imperial and colonial mentality about how it is defined in relation to this Other part of the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop was an interview with the British Independent Television Network (ITN) about more gene doping issues. This was a chance to see one of the media venues, specifically the Beijing International Convention Center, which is one of the major goals of the research I do at the Games. The BICC is very different from the IBC, the MPC and the BIMC and I'm not convinced all of the journalists really know how their space differs from others. If the IBC people -- the International Broadcast Centre -- just strolled over to the BIMC -- the Beijing International Media Center -- they'd discover a whole different Olympic world that exists beyond the sport. But most of them won't. Still, the BICC was even more interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ITN -- a non-rights holder -- sits within the NBC news set-up and it's not an accredited centre at all. However, a lot of these broadcasters have accreditation to the Main Press Center (MPC), so it feels as though there are many routes through which companies are trying to access Olympic news and information. We were kindly shown around the BICC, in exchange for my interviewing for them about gene doping. The presenter expressed that they've no issues with regard to using the Internet, everything was working excellently and they've even got a great studio backdrop of the Bird's Nest. All seems well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying to persuade the presenter that athletes should be allowed to use performance enhancements, we walked across to the Bird's Nest and Aquatic Center. It was much more animated than two days ago, but with a few more restrictions of movement and the promise of more to come. I still can't work out how the Olympic cauldron will be lit though. The place is full of small street acts, but very few toilets, no water vendors and no information kiosks anywhere. This takes its toll a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then take the No.1 Olympic Bus for a packed -- but air conditioned ride -- around the venues -- again, for the second time, but busier. We alight at the final stop and glance into a small neighbourhood where they have a reasonable sized screen, which I expect will be for the sports. If every such neighbourhood has this, then Beijing will have delivered the most extraordinary Live Site programme in history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not watching much news here. We've CCTV9 on from time to time and it's covering all the news you'd hope. I didn't see anything about the 'pole' protest at the stadium yesterday, but the violence in the North West of China was given the air space it deserved. Still frustrated that I can't upload to Flickr and have found that I can't access my university or personal servers either. Was it something I said?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;mdash; John McCain's campaign said Thursday it is returning $50,000 in contributions solicited by a foreign citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move follows the disclosure that the money was being raised by a Jordanian man who is a business partner of prominent Florida Republican Harry Sargeant III.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Thursday that Sargeant allowed a longtime business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba'a, to bring in some $50,000 in donations in March from members of a single extended family in California, the Abdullahs, along with several of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abdullahs and other Arab-Americans in California also contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republicans Rudolph Giuliani and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a longtime friend of Sargeant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, Abu Naba'a is a dual citizen of Jordan and the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for foreigners to contribute their own money to U.S. political campaigns, and McCain's campaign said Abu Naba'a made none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said some of the people solicited by Abu Naba'a had no intention of supporting McCain for president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rogers said "that just didn't sound right to us" so the money is being returned. He estimated the total at less than $50,000, saying "we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much Abu Naba'a solicited."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight months ago, a top fundraiser for Clinton, Norman Hsu, was indicted for making contributions to various political candidates in the names of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arizona Sen. McCain is co-sponsor of the campaign finance reform law that bears his name and the move is an effort to resolve any questions involving Sargeant before it turns into a major political problem for the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sargeant, who does extensive business with the federal government, is facing problems on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A House committee chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is looking into Sargeant's defense work shipping fuel to U.S. bases in Iraq as part of a probe into whether contractors are overcharging the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sargeant and Abu Naba'a are being sued in Florida by a former partner, the husband of a half-sister of the King of Jordan. The lawsuit alleges that Sargeant and Abu Naba'a swindled the business partner out of his share of the profits from valuable contracts with the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, Mohammad Anwar Farid Al-Saleh, says he obtained authorization from Jordan to permit Sargeant's company to ship oil across Jordanian territory to U.S. bases in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2004 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission says a foreign national may lawfully solicit political contributions, but the issue is more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal election law does not address whether it is legal for foreigners to solicit donations. At the same time, federal regulations say a foreign national may not participate in a person's decision-making regarding contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The 2004 opinion is very clear, but throwing the regulation into the mix muddies the water. The FEC could revisit the issue," said Paul S. Ryan, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group.&lt;/p&gt;
