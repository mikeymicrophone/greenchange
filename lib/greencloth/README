GreenCloth
==========

GreenCloth is derived from RedCloth, the defacto
text to html converter for ruby.

Improvements from RedCloth
--------------------------

* URLs are not accidently formatted (for example if a word *like/this* appears in the url, it will not be bold).

* Automagic URL recognition (ie http://riseup.net is turned into a link).

* Hard breaks are enabled, and work better (applied in fewer situations).

* Added "dictionary" block, which looks like a hanging indent.

Major changes from RedCloth
---------------------------

* Totally different linking system

* No HTML of any sort, except for <pre> and <code> tags.

* No horizontal rules.

* Leading spaces create blockquotes, not <pre><code>

GreenCloth Linking

[I like pages -> A good page]  ---> <a href="/mygroup/a-good-page">I like pages</a>
[I like pages -> 2452]         ---> <a href="/mygroup/2452">I like pages</a>
[other group/A good page]      ---> <a href="/other-group/a-good-page">A good page</a>
[I like pages -> other-group/] ---> <a href="/other-group/i-like-pages">I like pages</a>
