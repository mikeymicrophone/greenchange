Thanks for joining the Green Change Network.  Welcome!  Together, we're creating a world based on grassroots democracy, justice, sustainability and non-violence

There are many ways to check out the network.  Here are just a few ideas:

1) Make [your profile -> /me/profile/edit] page.  Add a photo, share your interests, start a blog and more.

2) [Connect -> /network/connect]  with other people and groups.   

3) Share your art, writing, videos, audio, photos and more.  Get heard.  Just go [to create -> /pages/new].

Our network is new.  We want your feedback, your opinions, your ideas.  So please join the [Feedback Group -> /groups/feedback] to help us improve the network.

If you need help, email d@greenchange.org or join the [Help Group -> /groups/networkhelp].  That's where you can ask questions and get answers from more experienced community members.

Have fun!
