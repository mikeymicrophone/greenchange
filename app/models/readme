groups networks and subgroups

information in networks and subgroups is transparent
to the group.

information in the group is hidden by default in the
network and subgroups.

by default, participation is limited to the current scope.
so, a subgroup node is typically only participatable by the direct
members of the subgroup, but visiable by all members of the group.


power = ability to participate in decisions. 
accountability = ability to view decisions.


a subgroup can belong to exactly one group or network.
a group can belong to many networks.
a network can belong to many networks.

a group cannot belong to a group.
a subgroup cannot belong to more than one group.
a network cannot belong a group.

networks
-----------

when a group joins a network, there are two special subgroups:

network council: a subgroup of the network, or the network itself.
group delegates: a subgroup of the group, or the group itself.

every member of 'delegates' becomes members of the 'council'. 

if delegates happens to be the entire group, every member of the group is on the council.
if council happens to be the entire network, then everyone can participate fully in council discussions.
