#
# SocialUser
# ====================================
#
# A SocialUser is a user that socializes. I bet you didn't see that coming.
#
# What does it mean to be social?
# 
# (1) you have a relationship to other users, friend and foe.
# (2) you have a relationship to groups, and to the group's
#     committees, networks and members.
# (3) you have a set of tags used in all these places.
#
# In crabgrass, all users are SocialUsers, but this stuff is kept here
# to try to make User.rb more readable.
#
# In short, any model stuff related to group memberships and user to user
# relations should go here.
#
#
# Columns
# --------
#
# version -- increments when any of the id caches are changed
# 
# id caches -- there are many columns to cache our relationships,
#   because they are used very frequently and take time to calculate.
#   The names of the cache attributes end with "_cache". 
#
# How to use
# -----------
# 
# There are two valid ways to establish membership between user and group:
#
# group.memberships.create :user => user
# user.memberships.create :group => group
#
# Other methods should not be used.
#
# Membership information is cached in the user table. It will get
# automatically updated whenever membership is created or destroyed. In cases
# of indirect membership (all_groups) the database is correctly updated
# but the in-memory object will need to be reloaded if you want the new data.
#
# However, when the structure of an organization changes (via adding/removing
# networks or committees), then the cache is not automatically updated. 
# In these cases, you need to manually clear the cache and reload the user. 
#

  ## Caching IDs
 
=begin 
The idea here is that every user in a social networking universe
has a lot of relationships to other entities that might be expensive
to discover. For example, a list of all your peers or a list of all
groups you have direct or indirect access to. So, we cache it, in
the form of serialized arrays of integers corresponding to the ids of the
foreign relationships.

If you are paying attention, you will realize this is stupid. A couple reasons
why it is not:

  (1) by using compressed integers for serialization, we can actually store
      a lot of ids without taking up too much space.
  (2) it is much faster to deserialize a big array of integers than it is
      to join in another table or make an extra query.

In many cases, all we *want* are the ids, since this is sufficient
to test membership and to display name and avatar (if ever get around
to creating a memcached for users and groups that stores [id,name,avatar_id]).

Also, we make a lot of queries of the form "group_id IN (1,2,3,4)".
This is fast, according to the mysql manual:

   If all values are constants, they are evaluated according to
   the type of expr and sorted. The search for the item then is
   done using a binary search. This means IN is very quick if
   the IN value list consists entirely of constants.

This suggests that if we stored the ids caches pre-sorted, it would be
slightly faster.

As a handy bit of fun, if any of these ids caches changes, we increment
the user's version. This can be then used to easily expire caches which
use these values.

  # Be careful with this method: it is called any time a Membership
  # object is created or destroyed, and it is also called any time
  # read_attribute(*_group_id_cache) is nil. Therefore, we better
  # set the id caches to non-nil in this method unless we want to
  # recurse forever.
